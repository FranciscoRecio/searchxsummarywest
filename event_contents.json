This panel will explore how integrating these essential competencies into core subjects such as math, science, and reading not only prepares students for career success, but also nurtures their personal well-being. Join education experts as they highlight the critical importance of cultivating hope, resilience, and a sense of belonging in students—qualities that are foundational for long-term success.​​10:15 - 11:00 AM: Leveraging Technology for the Future of Higher Education​Speaker: Nuno Fernandes, President, American Public University System​AI and related technologies can be catalysts to more personalized and immersive learning experiences. Higher education leaders must embrace these changes now, in responsible ways, in order to continue making positive contributions to society as a whole. In his presentation, Nuno Fernandes will highlight how technology is rapidly transforming the way students learn – and what this means for the future of higher education. This dynamic presentation will focus on:​How education has evolved over time, and how it will change in the next several years;​How AI itself is improving its value for students;​AI’s potential impact for society and education in particular; ​Realistic use cases for AI in education​11:00 - 11:30 AM: Communications in the Age of Education Disruption​Diana Marszalek, Global Head of News, PRovoke Media​Liz Willen, Executive Editor, The Hechinger Report​A one-on-one conversation between two leading journalists concerning the future of education in 2025. We anticipate a spirited and insightful discussion between the two editors of marquee outlets, PRovoke Media and The Hechinger Report, focused on the impact the new administration will have on education in the U.S. and globally. As we navigate a series of tectonic shifts—everything from AI to workforce readiness, changes in the teaching labor force to education technology coming into its own, major disruptions in higher education and long-established policy priorities—how will the sector continue to find relevance and authority with key audiences and influencers? This 30-minute discussion will illuminate the power of storytelling and high-quality journalism as well as the importance of trusted brands and voices at this unique moment.​11:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Lunch with Food Truck​12:45 - 1:30 PM: The State of K-12 Cybersecurity in 2025 & Navigating Top Threats​Speaker: Randy Rose, VP of Security Operations and Intelligence, The Center for Internet SecurityCyber attacks on K-12 institutions have become an inevitable reality; a staggering 82% of K-12 organizations experienced cyber incidents over the last 18 months. Between bad actors, malware, and now the rise of AI, education institutions have to be more vigilant than ever in their cybersecurity strategy. The Center for Internet Security will unpack findings from their latest cybersecurity report, assessing the K-12 threat landscape. Learn about top threats, concerns, and the most effective strategies in navigating these threats to keep your school, students, and data safe from cyber attacks.​​1:30 - 2:15 PM: Empowering Learners to Collaborate with AI (Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering)​Speakers:​Jonathan Cagan, David and Susan Coulter Head of Mechanical Engineering and Associate Director of the Human+AI Design Initiative​Christopher McComb, Gerard G. Elia Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of the Human+AI Design Initiative​AI is changing the way that we learn and practice STEM. Intelligent systems can provide real-time feedback to learners and are increasingly important in scientific innovation. Increasingly, students are learning how to use AI tools in the classroom. However, it is not sufficient to prepare students to simply master reactive AI tools. Instead, we also need to prepare them to be excellent collaborators with the proactive AI systems of tomorrow. In doing so, this session will emphasize the role of humans as central—not secondary—to drive effectiveness in the AI-enabled future, and the mandate for education to prepare practitioners for this new normal. By reimagining education through the lens of human-AI collaboration, we aim to equip students with the skills and mindset needed to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world.​2:15 - 3:00 PM: Guardians of Democracy: Libraries Ensure Information Access​Moderator: Jennifer Leitman, CMO, OverDrive​Speakers:​Skip Dye, SVP, Library Sales and Digital Strategy, Penguin Random House​Lisa Varga, Executive Director, Virginia Library Association​Join us for an insightful session exploring the vital connection between literacy, access, and democracy. Libraries cultivate informed citizens through literacy and upskill programs that foster critical thinking, media literacy and civic participation. Learn how libraries are serving as indispensable hubs for lifelong learning and community empowerment for everyone as one of the most trusted local resources.​​3:00 - 3:45 PM: The Ripple Effect: How Teacher PD Shapes the Future STEM Workforce​Moderator: Jeremy Anderson, CEO, National Math and Science Initiative​Speakers:​Robin Johnson Ford MBA, M. Ed. Director, Advanced Academics & Gifted and Talented, Desoto ISD​Andy Smith, Director, Giving & Volunteering at Texas Instruments; Executive Director, TI Foundation​Dr. Kristen Vesely, Director of Advanced Academics, Ector County ISD​Our country relies on the next generation to fill STEM jobs—but how can we make that a reality when students often shy away from STEM and educators lack the confidence and support to teach it effectively? Enter high-quality professional development. This discussion, led by education experts, explores the critical shift from simply cultivating STEM learners to empowering future professionals, emphasizing the role of early, real-world exposure in shaping career readiness. When teachers feel empowered, they, in turn, empower students to become the STEM leaders of tomorrow.​​3:45 - 4:45 PM: Closing Keynote: The Future of Education​Moderator: Liz Willen, Executive Editor, The Hechinger Report​Speakers:​Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers​Dr. Leah Austin, President & CEO, National Black Child Development Institute​Doreen Gehry Nelson, Founding Director, Design-Based Learning by the UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, Center X for the UCLA Design-Based Learning Project; Professor Emerita of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, School of Education and Integrative Studies; Adjunct Professor in the Cal Poly College of Environmental Design; and was Professor at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, from 2002-present ​​4:45 - 4:50 PM: Closing Remarks ​Marina Stenos, Managing Partner, FINN Partners​Emily Embury, Senior Partner, FINN Partners​5:00 - 6:00 PM: Humble Hang with music, cocktails & moreLocationAtelier 12051205 E Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX 78702, USAPresented byFINN X Humble VenturesSubscribeHosted ByEmily EmburyMarina StenosContact the HostReport EventAIWellnessWhat's NewDiscoverPricingHelpHost your event with Luma ↗",

Burcin Taner, M.D., Chair of the Transplant Center at the Mayo Clinic (Florida)Organ transplantation is one of the greatest innovations of modern medicine. Unfortunately, there is an immense shortage in the number of organs available for transplantation, leading to long wait times, deaths on the waiting list, and patients who are never even considered for a transplant. Developing biomedical technologies have an opportunity to limit or, potentially, eliminate this shortage. This session will highlight an ongoing partnership between Carnegie Mellon University and Mayo Clinic and their research to repair dysfunctional organs or fabricate new organs from scratch. This research includes ex-vivo organ repair, in which an organ is perfused for days to weeks outside the body and treated to repair damage, and 3D bioprinting, in which living tissue can be printed to replicate the structure and function of native organs.​11.30 AM –12.15 PM: Spurring Innovation: The Power of Local Ecosystems & Public-Private PartnershipsModerator: Patric Rayburn, Head of Engagement, Catalyst by Wellstar Speakers:  Allyson Eman, CEO, Venture Atlanta  Gareth Evans, Founder of VECKTA Claire Ross, Founder & CEO, MixEatUp  While change has always been the constant in innovation, the pace of change has reached fever-pitch.  In this engaging panel, founders, investors and innovation ecosystem leaders will discuss how local ecosystems are collaborating to maintain the momentum of innovation in healthcare and beyond.      ​This panel will explore how local innovation ecosystems and public-private partnerships are playing a crucial role in fueling venture activity, driving breakthrough solutions, and sustaining progress despite unpredictable challenges.    12.15 – 1.00 PM: Lunch Break and get to know people​1.00 - 1.30 PM: Delivering the Future of PharmacySpeaker: Amit Gir, CEO & Board-Certified Physician, Phox Health​1.30- 2.15 PM: AI and The Future of Pharma MarketingModerator: Kamya Elawadhi, Chief Client Officer, DocereeSpeakers:Cozi Namer - VP of Consumer and Clinician Innovation, PfizerJason Gee, Senior VP, Client Experience at Havas MediaJeff McDonald, CEO & Co-Founder at Kythera Labs2.15 – 2.45 PM: AI at the Crossroads: Navigating Innovation Amid U.S. Policy and DeregulationModerator: Ganesh Padmanabhan, CEO of Autonomize AISpeakers:Dr. Nasim Afsar, former Chief Health Officer of Oracle HealthDr. Pritesh Gandhi, former Chief Medical Officer of Dept of Homeland SecurityThe U.S. government's strategic initiatives, including the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, aim to harness AI to streamline federal operations and reduce systemic waste.

To join the event, please register below.

The power of narrative. In a world oversaturated with content, stories don’t just need to be told—they need to drive action. But what makes a narrative commercially powerful? Is it the art of emotional connection, the science of data, or the magic of cultural timing? Bringing together voices from academia, technology, and advertising, this debate will challenge conventional wisdom on how stories shape behaviour, influence industries, and create real value  to turn storytelling into storyselling.

To join the event, please register below. Request to JoinYou will be asked to verify token ownership with your wallet.About Event​Join us at UK House for a deep dive panel exploring money and power in the world of AI.​Investment into AI is projected to hit $600bn by 2027. Just this year Big Tech firms said they would invest $320 billion dollars in AI infrastructure. Governments have also thrown their weight behind AI investment announcements. One of President Trump’s first announcements was support for the $500bn “Stargate” data centre initiative, meanwhile France recently pledged 109bn euros of private investment into AI infrastructure.​There is no question that companies, countries, investors are spending big on AI in the hope of a big pay-off. But significant AI-driven profits remain elusive. ​Our panel will debate whether current AI investments amount to a bubble or are the tip of an iceberg and debate which countries are making the smartest AI plays. This is not just a question about money, it is also about power – who gets to shape the future of AI– governments, tech giants or entirely new players?  ​Join an expert panel of industry leaders, policy architects and AI specialists to explore the critical infrastructure policies and partnerships to build an AI enabled future. This discussion will feature speakers from:​Saumil Shah – VP – Chief of Staff to CEO at Arm​Polina Zvyagina – AI Policy Director at Meta​Austin Carson – Founder/President at SeedAI​William Cutler - Head of Tech Policy - British Consulate San Francisco (UK Government)​Moderated by​B Cavello - Director - Aspen Digital ​Our panel will explore:​Who owns AI’s future? Is this a question of China vs the US or can third countries or regions like the EU carve out a meaningful piece.​AI’s $600 billion dollar question: Are we witnessing an investment bubble? What should the role of governments be?​A global game:  which countries are making the smartest moves-  how should nations work together and what is needed.​This session is essential for innovators, policymakers and big thinkers who want to understand how nations can position themselves for success in the AI revolution- and will be followed by networking with nibbles and drinks.LocationPlease register to see the exact location of this event.Austin, TexasHosted ByIsobel WoodJoe Cowen111 GoingNia Pryce, Lida and 109 othersContact the HostReport EventAIWhat's NewDiscoverPricingHelpHost your event with Luma ↗",

AustinHustle Fund EventsRegister to See AddressAustin, TexasRegistrationWelcome! To join the event, please register below. RegisterYou will be asked to verify token ownership with your wallet.About Event​Let's hang!​​​As a founder, going through the fundraising process can be incredibly frustrating. ​​It takes an amazing amount of time and effort to convince an investor to agree to talk to you.​​​​And then, once you pitch your company, sometimes the investor never gets back to you. ​​Or if they do get back to you, oftentimes their rejection doesn't explain WHY they're not interested.​​​​All this can leave an entrepreneur feeling frustrated, dejected, and unsure of what can be done to improve in the future. ​​We think this stinks.​​​​That's why, on March 11, we're hosting a live pitch event for founders. And it's FREE to attend.​​Here's how it'll work:​RSVP to the event and submit your pitch deck.​​​​Up to 6 founders will be picked and have 2.5 minutes to pitch a panel of investors from Hustle Fund's Angel Squad.​The investors will ask follow-up questions and offer feedback to the founders.... just like in a real VC meeting!​​​​By the end of this event, you'll have a deeper understanding of why investors decide to invest in a company (or not). And the winner takes home a prize  ​​​​We'll leave some time at the end of the event for your questions... so come curious!​Who should come?​We designed this event for founders and investors. ​If you're a founder looking to get feedback on your pitch, you'll love this. If you're a founder just looking to learn from other founders, we invite you to register without submitting your deck, and come enjoy the show! We promise you'll get some big takeaways.​If you're an investor looking to meet more founders, or just hoping to learn more about how to evaluate companies, you'll also get a lot out of Batter Up!​🚨Take Note​This is an in-person event. There is no virtual option. You must be present, in-person, to be eligible to pitch.​Applications to pitch will close on Tuesday, March 4 at 5pm CST. If you have not submitted your deck by then, you will not be able to pitch.​Please be ready with your pitch in case you are selected.​​The Schedule​​​6pm: Get here, eat pizza, make friends​​​6:30-8pm: BatterUp! – Pitches from a few founders and investor panel feedback​​​8-9pm: Finish the pizza, make more friends​9pm: Say goodbye​Who's behind this?​Hustle Fund is an early stage venture firm that believes great founders can look like anyone and come from anywhere. We invest in startups all over the world and we'd love to see what you're building. Learn more about us.​Angel Squad was created by Hustle Fund for you to Learn, Invest and Network!

VCs like my flagship Reverse VC sponsor, Mark Suster think there are two sides to an equation  ​Getting money is a dirty business model. Paying money is reverse sugar daddy. Paying senior executives money to be your #ReverseSugarDaddy is true female empowerment. What this party strives to accomplish ​✅ Laugh together at a DrizzleDrizzle party​✅ Business models can be engineered towards our favor via, “Gender reversal, VC exercises“​✅ Parties can activate knowledge​✅ Similar to reverse VC pitch is the reverse sugar daddy pitch​✅ Ladies at SXSW, Have you ever paid for it? IT being A seasoned executive whom you pay​✅ Recruiting, compensating and rewarding, seasoned executives Is A business model, we will practice as females​We all have a friend of a friend who does only fans, perhaps at this year‘s 2025 SXSW, we will be the friend who reverses the sugar daddy equation. Let us not scoff at #DrizzleDrizzle.
